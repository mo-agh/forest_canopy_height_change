# forest_canopy_height_change
In this project, I quantified forest canopy height changes in Gabon from 2016 to 2023 using LiDAR data. The 2023 LiDAR data had ground-finding issues, which I corrected before the analysis. The scatter plots below illustrate the impact of this correction on the data. Additionally, canopy height changes were analyzed across five categories, with a mean and standard deviation of 0.7 meters and 3.7 meters, respectively, across all categories.
